Project Overview:


Objective: 
The goal of this project is to get you more familiar with the LoRA  training  technique  often  used  with  Large  Language Models and its challenges. For this reason, you will be working on building a Medical LLM that can answer medical questions where we would take a dataset and fine-tune an existing LLM with it. 


Just to give you a heads up: We won't be having a model performing like ChatGPT or Bard, but at least we will have an idea about how these powerful models work and how to deal with the challenges associated with them.
